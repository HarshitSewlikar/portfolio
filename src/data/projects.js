    overview:
      "An interactive visualization platform for sorting, searching, and graph algorithms. A precomputed step engine animates each comparison, swap, and visit on Canvas or DOM, and a multi-provider AI chatbot (OpenRouter → OpenAI → Hugging Face fallback) answers questions about the algorithm in plain English.",
    myRole:
      "Built the full React + Vite frontend, the step precomputation engine, the dual rendering layer (Framer Motion for bars, Canvas for graphs), and the Express proxy server that secures the AI provider keys behind a fallback chain.",
    implementation:
      "Each algorithm page precomputes all steps into an array of state objects; a useEffect setTimeout loop advances currentStep at 1000/speed ms. Sorting uses Framer Motion + DOM bars (≤100, accessible, GPU-accelerated). Graphs use HTML5 Canvas (up to 400+ nodes, immediate-mode redraws). The AI chat hits /api/ai, proxied by Vite to an Express server that walks a provider priority chain and returns plain-text responses that a custom Markdown parser renders inline.",

    myRole:
      "Designed the data model, built the views and URL routing, wrote the templates, and deployed the site live on a cPanel shared host. Owned the project end-to-end as a solo Django build.",
    implementation:
      "Django's URL router dispatches each request to a view function. The contact view validates the enquiry form, saves it via the ORM to SQLite, and flashes a success message. The login view uses Django's built-in authenticate() + login() with PBKDF2-hashed passwords, and the dashboard view requires an authenticated session before rendering the enquiry list. Templates use a shared header/footer includes pattern, and AOS + Swiper add scroll-in animations and the homepage carousel.",

      "A conversational query interface for real-estate lead data. Users type questions in natural English; an LLM (Nemotron via OpenRouter) translates the question into pandas code, the code runs in a sandboxed exec() against the in-memory DataFrame, and the deterministic result returns with the generated code shown for transparency.",
    myRole:
      "Built the FastAPI backend end-to-end: data loading, prompt construction with the dataset schema, the OpenRouter call, code cleaning, and the sandboxed exec. Built the vanilla-JS frontend with a stats sidebar, auto-resizing input, and dynamic table rendering.",
    implementation:
      "On startup, the Excel file is loaded into a global pandas DataFrame. Each query POSTs to /query, which builds a system prompt containing the column schema (preventing column-name hallucination), calls OpenRouter for pandas code, strips the markdown fences, and runs the code via exec() against a DataFrame copy with restricted globals. The response includes the answer, the generated code, a summary, and any tabular data — which the frontend renders as a table with a toggle to view the code.",

Also got a feel for sandboxing user-generated code and designing prompts that constrain the model to a known schema.",
